This project was an exercise in getting experience with mirroring a template without seeing how it was built, much like a front-end developer would be given a PSD file to turn into a webpage.

Skills learned or added upon during this process were CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, favicons, & webfonts.  Additionally upon look of the actual website when I was done, I was able to get some insight one pseudo-selectors and how they will speed up my design process.
